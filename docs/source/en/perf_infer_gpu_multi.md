# Distributed GPU inference

[Tensor parallelism](./perf_train_gpu_many#tensor-parallelism) shards a model onto multiple GPUs and parallelizes computations such as matrix multiplication. It enables fitting larger model sizes into memory and is faster because each GPU can process a tensor slice.

> [!TIP]
> Tensor parallelism is currently only supported for [Llama](./model_doc/llama). Open a GitHub issue or pull request to add tensor parallelism support for another model.

Set `tp_plan="auto"` in [`~AutoModel.from_pretrained`] to enable tensor parallelism for inference.

```py
import os
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# initialize distributed environment
rank = int(os.environ["RANK"])
device = torch.device(f"cuda:{rank}")
torch.distributed.init_process_group("nccl", device_id=device)

# enable tensor parallelism
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct",
    tp_plan="auto",
)

# prepare input tokens
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct")
prompt = "Can I help"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to(device)

# distributed run
outputs = model(inputs)
```

Launch the inference script above on [torchrun](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/run.html) with 4 processes per GPU.

```bash
torchrun --nproc-per-node 4 demo.py
```

You can benefit from considerable speed ups for inference, especially for inputs with large batch size or long sequences.

For a single forward pass on [Llama](./model_doc/llama) with a sequence length of 512 and various batch sizes, you can expect the following speed ups.
